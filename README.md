jquery-loading
==============

A loading library for jquery that shows a dialog whenever ajax is called

To install, just include script in your header.  Nothing else is needed.


Why I built this
----------------

I believe it is good UI to let the user know when there's some AJAXy goodness going on.

I wanted a library that achieves a few objectives.  I couldn't find anything that matched my criteria:

+ Should hook into the JQuery $.ajax call
+ Shouldn't flicker on a quick, less than 1 second AJAX call (ie, have some minimum duration)
+ Be extremely lightweight
+ Shouldn't require additional CSS or HTML


Please help contribute!!!
